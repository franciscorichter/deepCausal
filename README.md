# **Predictive Modeling using Causal Inference and Deep Learning**

## **Short Description**

This project explores the integration of causal inference techniques with deep learning models to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability. By combining these approaches, we aim to identify true causal relationships within data, leading to more robust and insightful predictive models. This work has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and social sciences.

## **Methods**

### **1. Causal Inference**
We apply causal inference methods to determine the causal relationships between variables, ensuring that the predictive models focus on features that have a genuine impact on the outcomes. This step reduces bias and enhances the reliability of the predictions.

### **2. Deep Learning**
We leverage state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to build models that can capture complex patterns and relationships within the data. These models are designed to work efficiently with large datasets, providing both scalability and accuracy.

### **3. Combined Framework**
Our approach integrates causal inference into the deep learning workflow, allowing for the construction of models that are not only predictive but also provide insights into the causality of the relationships identified.
